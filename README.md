# Mu Python template

Template for [mu.semte.ch](http://mu.semte.ch)-microservices written in Python3.12. Based on the [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)-framework.

## Quickstart

Create a `Dockerfile` which extends the `semtech/mu-python-template`-image and set a maintainer.
```docker
FROM semtech/mu-python-template:2.0.0-beta.3
LABEL maintainer="maintainer@example.com"
```

Create a `web.py` entrypoint-file. (naming of the entrypoint can be configured through `APP_ENTRYPOINT`)
```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()

@router.get("/hello")
def hello() -> PlainTextResponse:
    return "Hello from the mu-python-template!"
```

Build the Docker-image for your service
```sh
docker build -t my-python-service .
```

Run your service
```sh
docker run -p 8080:80
```

You now should be able to access your service's endpoint
```sh
curl localhost:8080/hello
```

## Developing a microservice using the template

### Dependencies

If your service needs external libraries other than the ones already provided by the template (FastAPI, uvicorn, SPARQLWrapper, rdflib, and jsonapi-pydantic), you can specify those in a [`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/)-file. The template will take care of installing them when you build your Docker image and when you boot the template in development mode for the first time.

You may find that your python dependencies may depend on C/C++ libraries which may not be present (e.g. libgeos for a package such as shapely). In order to overcome this issue, add a file build.sh which is executed before installation of python dependencies. E.g.:
```bash
#!/bin/sh

apt update && apt install -y libgeos-dev
```

### Development mode

By leveraging Dockers' [bind-mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/), you can mount your application code into an existing service image. This spares you from building a new image to test each change. Just mount your services' folder to the containers' `/app`. On top of that, you can configure the environment variable `MODE` to `development`. That enables live-reloading of the server, so it immediately updates when you save a file.

example docker-compose parameters:
```yml
    environment:
      MODE: "development"
    volumes:
      - /home/my/code/my-python-service:/app
```

### Helper methods
<a id="helpers.generate_uuid"></a>

#### `generate_uuid`

```python
def generate_uuid()
```

> Generates a random unique user id (UUID) based on the host ID and current time

<a id="helpers.log"></a>

#### `log`

```python
def log(msg, *args, **kwargs)

### Waiting for system ready

Full functionality for waiting for the system to be stable and ready (database up, triplestore ready, migrations ran, ...) is being planned as a cross-template feature, but not ready at the moment. While waiting for this functionality to arrive in the template, one can add a custom function that does a much more simplistic check like this

```python
def wait_for_triplestore():
    triplestore_live = False
    log("Waiting for triplestore...")
    while not triplestore_live:
        try:
            result = query(
                """
                SELECT ?s WHERE {
                ?s ?p ?o.
                } LIMIT 1""",
            )
            if result["results"]["bindings"][0]["s"]["value"]:
                triplestore_live = True
            else:
                raise Exception("triplestore not ready yet...")
        except Exception as _e:
            log("Triplestore not live yet, retrying...")
            time.sleep(1)
    log("Triplestore ready!")
```

### Writing SPARQL Queries

The template itself is unopinionated when it comes to constructing SPARQL-queries. However, since Python's most common string formatting methods aren't a great fit for SPARQL queries, we hereby want to provide an example on how to construct a query based on [template strings](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/string.html#template-strings) while keeping things readable.

```py
from string import Template
from helpers import query
from escape_helpers import sparql_escape_uri

my_person = "http://example.com/me"
query_template = Template("""
PREFIX mu: <http://mu.semte.ch/vocabularies/core/>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT ?name
WHERE {
    $person a foaf:Person ;
        foaf:firstName ?name .
}
""")
query_string = query_template.substitute(person=sparql_escape_uri(my_person))
query_result = query(query_string)
```

### Functions on startup
Because of the way FastApi works, logic that should be run on startup should always be wrapped with an `@app.on_evente("startup")` decorator. For instance:

```py
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    wait_for_triplestore()
    # on startup fail existing busy tasks
    fail_busy_and_scheduled_tasks()
    # on startup also immediately start scheduled tasks
    process_open_tasks()
```

## Deployment

Example snippet for adding a service to a docker-compose stack:
```yml
my-python:
  image: my-python-service
  environment:
    LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
```

### Environment variables
#### General

- `LOG_LEVEL` takes the same options as defined in the Python [logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) module.

- `MODE` to specify the deployment mode. Can be `development` as well as `production`. Defaults to `production`

- `MU_SPARQL_ENDPOINT` is used to configure the SPARQL endpoint.

  - By default this is set to `http://database:8890/sparql`. In that case the triple store used in the backend should be linked to the microservice container as `database`.


- `MU_APPLICATION_GRAPH` specifies the graph in the triple store the microservice will work in.

  - By default this is set to `http://mu.semte.ch/application`. The graph name can be used in the service via `settings.graph`.


- `MU_SPARQL_TIMEOUT` is used to configure the timeout (in seconds) for SPARQL queries.

#### SPARQL Query Logging
- `LOG_SPARQL_ALL`: Log *all* executed queries, read as well as update (default `True`)

- `LOG_SPARQL_QUERIES`: Log *read* queries (default: `undefined`). Overrules `LOG_SPARQL_ALL`

- `LOG_SPARQL_UPDATES`: Log *update* queries (default `undefined`). Overrules `LOG_SPARQL_ALL`.

The string "true", ignoring casing, is considered `True`.  All other values are considered `False`.

## Other

### Reassigning `app`
In regular FastAPI applications (e.g. those not run within this template) you are required to define `app` by using `app = FastAPI()` or similar. This does *not* need to be done in your web.py, as this is handled by the microservice architecture/template. Redefining this may cause `The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.` to be thrown on your routes, which can be luckily be fixed by simply removing the previously mentioned `app = ...` line.

If you do not like this behavior (because e.g. your IDE does not find the app variable), it is possible (as is documented in this readme) to define an APIRouter object in your web.py file. It will be automatically picked up by the template. In this scenario, do not override the app variable as it could lead to the same error as before.

### readme.py
To simplify documenting the helper functions, `README.py` can be used to import & render the docstrings into README.md.
Usage:
```python3
python3 -m pip install pydoc-markdown
python3 README.py
```
You can customise the output through the API configuration! See [README.py](README.py) && the [pydoc-markdown docs](https://niklasrosenstein.github.io/pydoc-markdown/).

## Migrate from Flask based versions
Previous versions of this template were based on Flask. Effort was made to keep as much backward compatible as possible.
However, some things were slightly modified or require your attention

### Defining routes
Flask uses an `@app.route` syntax, FastAPI provides several functions on the annotator object based on the HTTP method (`@api.get`, `@api.route`). You may need to update this in your code

### Typing
FastAPI heavily uses type annotations to determine what goes in and out of your API. If the return type is not specified, a JSONResponse is assumed and returning e.g. a string will result in an error. It is highly recommended to use type annotations and pydantic as much as possible to define request / response models. More information: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/features/#pydantic-features

### Error handling
Error handling in FastAPI is much more involved (read about it [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/handling-errors/)).
The `helpers.error` function was kept for backward compatibility but we encourage you to simple raise exceptions (more specifically the BaseHTTPException which is automatically injected by the template)
```python
from starlette.responses import PlainTextResponse
from fastapi import APIRouter

router = APIRouter()
@router.get("/hello")
def hello() -> PlainTextResponse:
    raise BaseHTTPException(detail="test")
```
Advanced scenarios are possible, you can introduce your own Exception hierarchy, and insert specific handlers for them through the app variable:
```python
class UnicornException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name

@app.exception_handler(UnicornException)
def unicorn_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: UnicornException):
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=418,
        content={"message": f"Oops! {exc.name} did something."},
    )

@app.get("/hello/{name}")
def hello(name: str) -> PlainTextResponse:
    raise UnicornException(name=name)
```

### Asynchronous request handlers
Unless you know what you are doing, methods annotated with @app or any router you declared (which then become web routes) should
always be declared as synchronous methods (no async in front!). This might make your service blocking
on computationally demanding requests.

More information [here](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/async/#in-a-hurry)

### Startup functions
Be sure to wrap your startup functions with a `@app.on_event("startup")` decorator
